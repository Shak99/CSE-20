Reflection: Debugging Process

1. How many types of errors were there?
-Variables were declared more than once, declared as another data type,
Variables were used before they were declared, and syntax errors like grouping an expression together for proper order of operations.

2. How do you know when you have found every error (bugs)?
-The code has no red x marks next to the line, and running the program works as planned.

3. What was your testing strategy of the modified program after it runs?
-To see if the chance to input the numbers was available, and if the output of the operations were the same as the data type it was declared to be.
