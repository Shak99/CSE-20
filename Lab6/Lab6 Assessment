-The minimum is three

3. What does Dead code mean?
-Dead code is code that has been inputted correctly, but does does have a condition in order to execute the code.

4. What is the maximum number of output statements showing the relation between a and b for BooleanIfElse?
-One is the maximum.

5. What is the value of a and b where BooleanIfElse will print out “is less than or
equal to”?
-a and b can be the same number, or a can be any number less than b, and b canbe any number greater than a.
