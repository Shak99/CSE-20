1. int [] myVals = new int [10];
2. myVals[8] = x;
3. myVals[2] = 555;
4. myVals[1] = 777;
5. int[] myVals = {10, 10, 10, 10};

Assessment Logic Check:

1a. Whatever the max number entered is plus one.
1b. Because an array always starts with an index of zero, so you have to add 1 so it exactly knows how many numbers you want inputed.
1c. No, because it's going to have one less numbered entered than expected.

2a. We initialized the variable before starting the new loop so the number values won't combine.
2b. Yes, you can use any letter or word to replace i.

3a. The value of i plus 1 less than or equal to the max value. If it is true, it will go through the loop.
3b. The i will stay its value as it is less than or equal to the max, go through the loop, and at the end add a 1 to it.
