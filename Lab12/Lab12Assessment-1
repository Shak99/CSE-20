Assessment Logic Check:
1a. We used long for a higher maximum and minimum input of numbers so the user can input a larger number
1b. Arrays start at zero, but [max + 2] makes it start at 1.
2. while 1 == 1;
3a. So the min value is always smaller than the max value
3b. So the max value is always bigger than the min value.
